Student Performance Predictor
Overview
This project predicts student academic performance (e.g., exam scores or pass/fail status) using machine learning models trained on student demographic and educational data such as gender, ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation course.

Key Features
Input student details via a web form.

Predict performance (e.g., math score or pass/fail).

Use supervised ML algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

Provide insights on factors affecting performance.

Typical Workflow
Dataset: Use publicly available datasets like Students Performance in Exams (Kaggle).

Preprocess data (handle categorical variables, missing data).

Train/test split.

Train ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, Naive Bayes).

Evaluate model accuracy.

Deploy model in a Django app with a user-friendly interface for input and prediction.
